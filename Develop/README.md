The list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed).

Each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red).

I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog.

The properties for that task are saved in localStorage.

Cards have a delete button.

Cards are draggable.

When I refresh the page, then the saved tasks persist.
